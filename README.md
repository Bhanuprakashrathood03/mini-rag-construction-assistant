# 🏗️ Mini RAG Construction Assistant (Ollama-Powered)

This project implements a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline designed for a **construction marketplace assistant**.  
It retrieves relevant answers **grounded in internal company documents** — such as FAQs, policies, and specifications — and generates responses using **Llama 3 (via Ollama)**.  

Built with **FAISS** for vector search, **Sentence Transformers** for semantic embeddings, and **Streamlit** for an interactive UI,  
the system demonstrates end-to-end **document chunking, embedding, retrieval, and grounded answer generation**.  

Users can ask questions like:  
> “What factors affect construction project delays?”  

The assistant responds with **fact-based**, explainable answers derived directly from your uploaded documents — ensuring **accuracy, transparency, and zero hallucinations**.

## 🧠 Architectural Highlights

1. **Document Embedding**
   - Uses `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` to create compact, high-quality embeddings.
   - Ideal for semantic similarity and contextual retrieval in low-latency systems.

2. **Vector Indexing**
   - Powered by `FAISS` (Facebook AI Similarity Search).
   - Stores all document embeddings locally for fast cosine-similarity–based retrieval.

3. **Local LLM Inference**
   - The RAG pipeline integrates `Llama 3` running locally via `Ollama`, ensuring privacy and offline operability.
   - Prompts are designed to ensure grounded answers strictly within retrieved context.

4. **Interactive Interface**
   - Built with `Streamlit` for simplicity and transparency.
   - Users can type questions, view real-time streamed answers, and inspect retrieved context chunks.

5. **Environment**
   - Managed through Python’s built-in `venv` to isolate dependencies and simplify deployment.

# 📦 Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to set up and run the **Mini RAG Construction Assistant** locally.

### 🧰 Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:
* 🐍 **Python 3.11+**
* 💻 **pip** (Python package manager)
* 🧠 **Ollama** (for running the local Llama 3 model)
* 🧩 **git** (for cloning the repository)

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the project from GitHub:

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/Bhanuprakashrathood03/mini-rag-construction-assistant.git](https://github.com/Bhanuprakashrathood03/mini-rag-construction-assistant.git)
cd mini-rag-construction-assistant
```
### 2️⃣ Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

To keep dependencies isolated, create a Python virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
```
Activate it using:

🖥️ macOS / Linux
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```
🪟 Windows
```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3️⃣ Install Dependencies

Once inside the virtual environment, install all the required Python packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
---
### This will install key libraries like:

streamlit — Web UI

sentence-transformers — Embedding model

faiss-cpu — Vector search engine

numpy, torch, requests — Core dependencies

---

### 4️⃣ Install and Start Ollama

Ollama allows you to run Llama 3 locally (no API required).

Download and install Ollama from 👉 https://ollama.ai

Then, open your terminal and start the Ollama server:
```bash
ollama serve
```

Pull the Llama 3 model for local use:
```bash
ollama pull llama3
```
💡 Tip: Make sure the Ollama service is running before you query the assistant.


### 5️⃣ Build the FAISS Index

This step processes your documents into embeddings and builds the local FAISS index.

From the project root:
```bash
cd src
python build_index.py
```

This will:

Load documents from the **/data folder**

Split them into smaller chunks

Create embeddings using sentence-transformers

Save the FAISS index and metadata to **/faiss_index/**

You should see a confirmation like:
```
✅ FAISS index saved to /faiss_index/indecimal_index.faiss
✅ Metadata saved to /faiss_index/metadata.pkl
🎉 Success! Your FAISS index and metadata are ready to use.
```

### 6️⃣ Launch the Streamlit App

Finally, start the web application:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

After launching, Streamlit will provide a link such as:

Local URL: http://localhost:8501

Network URL: http://192.168.xx.xx:8501

👉 Open http://localhost:8501
 in your browser to use the app.

 # 🧩 How It Works

The **Mini RAG Construction Assistant** follows a complete **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** workflow —  
from document chunking and embedding to vector retrieval and context-aware LLM generation.

---

# 🔹 Document Processing

1. Loads all `.md` files from the `data/` directory  
2. Splits text into smaller **semantic chunks** (~200–300 words each) for better embedding quality  
3. Generates **dense vector embeddings** using  
   [`sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2)

🧠 Example snippet (from `build_index.py`):

```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
model = SentenceTransformer("all-MiniLM-L6-v2")
embeddings = model.encode(chunks, convert_to_numpy=True)
```

# 📊 Evaluation & Quality Analysis

After successfully building the FAISS index and embedding all documents,  
the system retrieved relevant chunks and generated answers using **Llama 3 via Ollama**.
